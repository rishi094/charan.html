<p><b>Motu Patlu</b> is an Indian animated sitcom that premiered on Nickelodeon in India on 16 October 2012. This show is available in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Marathi, Kannada and Bengali. The series is adapted from the classic comic strip Lotpot.[5] It focuses on the misadventures of two friends, Motu and Patlu, landing in trouble and comical situations, later being rescued only by luck. It is one of the most popular kids' shows in India.[6]

    Plot
    Motu and Patlu are two friends living in Furfuri Nagar.[7] Samosas are Motu's favorite food, and he frequently tries to steal them from a small shopkeeper named Chaiwala who makes the best samosas in the town, along with selling tea. After Motu eats samosas, he temporarily gains more energy and strength. Motu is mainly the black sheep of the duo, unintentionally creating problems due to his incompetency while Patlu is the smart one who always tries to stop him. The two land in trouble and comical situations, later being rescued only by luck. Occasionally, Ghasitaram misdirects and swindles them by making them try Dr. Jhatka's vast repertoire of quirky gadgets and gizmos.
    
    The main antagonist of the series is a criminal named "John the Don" (briefly and very famously known as John) who is accompanied by his two big but weak and dumb henchmen, Number 1 and Number 2 who steal people's money and jewelry and create havoc in Furfuri Nagar. John intends to become a don, but his plans always fail due to the heroic actions of Motu and Patlu, who trap and expose him and his plans tit for tat. In some episodes, John tries to harm them by stealing Dr. Jhatka's newest gadget and using it against Motu and Patlu, but they eventually manage to give John a taste of his own medicine.</p>
